# SpringBootBirthdayCalendar
SpringBootBirthdayCalendar

Tools You Will Need
Maven 3.0+ is your build tool
Your favorite IDE. We use Eclipse.
JDK 1.8+

Creating the Project With Spring Initializr
Creating a REST service with Spring Initializr is a cake walk. We will use Spring Web MVC as our web framework.

Spring Initializr is a great tool to bootstrap your Spring Boot projects.


http://start.spring.io/
the following steps have to be done.

Base project is : https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-and-spring-jdbc-with-h2

You can refer the steps that they mentioned.

Import the project into Eclipse. (File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project)
Starter Projects in pom.xml
Below is the list of starter projects in pom.xml.

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jdbc</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
    <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>


Initialize the H2 In-Memory Database With the Schema
We will use H2 as the database.

H2 provides a web interface called the H2 Console to see the data. Letâ€™s enable that console in the application.properties

/src/main/resources/application.properties

# Enabling H2 Console
spring.h2.console.enabled=true


When you reload the application, you can launch the H2 Console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console.

Tip: Make sure that you use jdbc:h2:mem:testdb as the JDBC URL.

When you use the right JDBC URL given above, you should see an empty schema when you click the Connect button. Image

Once you done with you can run teh project in 

http://localhost:8080

There you can find Birthday Calendar which includes add, edit & delete options.
Also includes search option with by name and by place.

The same can be viewed in H2 console.

Thanks!
